            NodeJS is a cross-platform and opensource Javascript runtime
            environment that allows the javascript to be run on the server-side.
            Nodejs allows Javascript code to run outside the browser. Nodejs
            comes with a lot of modules and mostly used in web development.

              Since we have outlined the advantages and disadvantages of
              Node.js, let's see how they translate into the practical aspects.
              We will try to determine when to use Node.js and what is Node.js
              used for in web development in order to achieve the best

                Since, MongoDB is a NoSQL database, so we need to understand
                when and why we need to use this type of database in the
                real-life applications. Since in normal circumstances, MongoDB
                always preferred by the developers or project managers when our
                main concern is the deal with large volume of data with a high
                performance. If we want to insert thousands of records in a
                second, then MongoDB is the best choice for that. Also,
                horizontal scaling (adding new columns) is not so easy process
                in any RDBMS systems. But in case of MongoDB, it is very much
                easy since it is a schema less database. Also, this type of work
                can be directly handled by the application automatically. There
                is no need to any type of administrative work for perform any
                type of horizontal scaling in the MongoDB. MongoDB is good for
                the below types of situations :

              <li>E-Commerce type of product-based applications</li>

              MongoDB is not only database which can perform only CRUD (Create,
              Read, Update and Delete) operations with the data. Except these,
              MongoDB also contains so many important features due which MongoDB
              become the most popular database in the NoSQL category

            Structured Query language (SQL) pronounced as 'S-Q-L' or sometimes
            as "See-Quel" is the standard language for dealing with Relational

            NoSQL is used for Big data and real-time web apps. For example

          <span className="bg-slate-200 px-1 rounded">Jwt</span>And how does It
          works?
        </h2>
        <p>
          JWT stands for JESON WEB Tockens.JWT are mainly used for
          authentication. After a user logs in to an application, the
          application will create a JWT and send it back to the user. Subsequent
          requests by the user will include the JWT. The token tells the server
          what routes, services, and resources the user is allowed to access.
          JWTs are a good way of securely transmitting information between
          parties because they can be signed, which means you can be sure that
          the senders are who they say they are. Additionally, the structure of
          a JWT allows you to verify that the content hasn't been tampered with.
